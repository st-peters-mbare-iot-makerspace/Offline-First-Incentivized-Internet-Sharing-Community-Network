A community-driven project prototyped in **Mbare, Zimbabwe** during the [Internet Society 2019 Chapterthon](https://www.internetsociety.org).  
The system enables **offline-first connectivity** and **incentivized internet sharing**, ensuring residents stay connected even when the broader internet is unavailable.

## ‚ú® Project Overview

This project combines:

- **Android Mobile Application** ‚Äì an offline-first app for access to cached educational and community content (e.g., [Kolibri](https://learningequality.org/kolibri/)).  
- **Community Network CDN** ‚Äì a cluster of Raspberry Pis orchestrated with Kubernetes, serving as a local content distribution backbone.  
- **Blockchain Incentives** ‚Äì built on the **Hype Open Protocol (HOP)** SDK, enabling tokenized peer-to-peer communication over Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth, and local Wi-Fi.

üëâ The model empowers community groups (like **IAmMbare**) to **share excess fixed-plan internet** with neighbors while earning **HOP tokens** for their contributions.
